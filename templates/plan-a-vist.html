            <h2>What to Expect</h2>
            <p>
                Aspiring to be a gospel-centered community, we talk a lot about making this a safe place
                for real-time sinful people to be in journey with Christ. There is no limit to God's grace
                as accomplished for us by Christ.
            </p>
            <p>
                And aspiring to not just learn about Christ and the good news of the gospel we talk a lot
                about participating in Christ's presence. We do this both in the mystery of one-anothering
                in the power of the Holy Spirit, and in the mystery of sacramental worship wherein we do
                the gospel in the ancient temple pattern of four movements.
            </p>
            <p>
                Through it all, Christ is in the midst of us by the Holy Spirit as our prophet, priest and
                king. So we hope you will join us and enjoy our journey together in Christ.
            </p>
            <div class="visit-highlight">
                <strong>Welcome:</strong> You are safe, loved, and invited to come as you are as we walk
                with Christ together.

                    <p>
                        You will find a wide range of attire, from t-shirts and jeans to the occasional
                        bowtie. Wear what makes you feel comfortable worshiping God.

                        There is parking available on our property, however, there is not enough for everyone.
                        Additional parking can be found on Bradley Street beside our building, on Whitney before
                        you get to our building coming from Trumbull St./Downtown, and at two Yale parking lots
                        north of the church on Whitney Ave. Lot 16: Gibbs Lab at Whitney Ave. and Humphrey St.,
                        and the Whitney Ave. Garage located behind 221 Whitney Ave. For safety, exit our lot
                        on the Bradley St. side only.

                    <p>
                        As you enter the sanctuary, you will be greeted by folks who will hand you a worship
                        bulletin that will direct you through every step of our service including explanations
                        of why we are carrying out each element.

                    <h3>A Safe Place</h3>
                    <p>
                        People often tell us that they have found CPC to be a very friendly place (what most
                        people who stick around will say initially attracted them to come back a second time).
                        But more than friendly, it is often talked about as a safe place where people can be in
                        route no matter what the location of your spiritual journey.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The spirituality of CPC is very much about grace as this not only makes it okay to be
                        morally flawed and/or broken in some way, but expected even. There will be people there
                        that are not yet Christians, people who are Christians and left the church and are
                        venturing back into the church, and even people who have been going to church for a long
                        time but are finding that the closer they get to God the more they see how flawed they
                        are in comparison, and how much more loved and accepted than they ever expected possible
                        because of what Christ accomplishes for us.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So come as you are, both outwardly and inwardly, and let happen what happens. It is safe.

                    <p>
                        We love our children and enjoy having them in worship. That being said, we do have a
                        quality and carefully managed childcare located in the children's wing of the church
                        (at end of foyer) for any and all children who at any time during the service are
                        getting antsy or are distracting their parents from worship. It is intentionally a
                        free time for guided play to allow children to release some energy before they rejoin
                        their parents after the sermon.

                        The booklet "Together in God's Presence: Children and Families Together in Covenant
                        Worship" explains our philosophy of children in relation to worshiping together with
                        some very practical ways to help your children experience worship for themselves even
                        if they do not understand much of it.

                        to know some people while eating a catered meal.
