            <h1 class="about-sub-title">Our Total Christ Spirituality</h1>
            <p class="about-body-text">
                We want this to be all about Christâ€”his work, not
                ours, as the basis of our relationship to God and one another,
                and his glory, not ours or any popular leader, as the object of our
                ultimate affection and respect. It is our desire to
                experience total Christ, not just one or another brand of Christ.
            </p>
            <p class="about-body-text">
                The term "Total Christ" originates from the
                5th-century pastor-theologian St. Augustine, who described the
                relationship of Christ's incarnational ministry (past) to his
                ongoing ascension ministry (present) as
                "the Word was made flesh, and dwelled among us; to that flesh is joined the church, and there is made total Christ, both head and body."
            </p>

            <h2 class="about-sub-title">The Five Marks</h2>
            <p class="about-body-text">
                <strong>1. Gospel-Centered:</strong> Trust in the
                gospel motivates us to be humble because we know Christ's work to us
                is purely a gift, but also boldly confident in the face of shame
                and sin because it's based in God's power! This grounds us
                in God's finished work on the cross, where he forgave our
                sins and reconciled us to himself. Everything we do is
                motivated from and by the gospel.
                <strong style="font-weight: bold;">Think: Humble,
                    honest, authentic, gracious, safe, desire
                    to be truly known and loved by God and
                    others</strong>
            </p>
            <p class="about-body-text">
                <strong>2. Missional: </strong> More (though not
                less!) than being evangelistic, we strive to be missional because God
                promises to dwell with His people in all their God-given
                cultures, languages, and demographics through the church. This grounds us
                in God's global presence, where the church is the evangelist
                for a whole new way of life, showing the world who Jesus is and
                what it means to follow Him in all our relationships.
                <strong style="font-weight: bold;">Think: Culturally
                    self-aware, open & inviting, purposeful,
                    holistic evangelism</strong>
            </p>
            <p class="about-body-text">
                <strong>3. Confessional - Christ as our Prophet:
                </strong>We are not the first ones to consider what church should be
                (thank God!). We humbly submit to God's revelation in the Word as
                it has been historically interpreted, seeking to be united in
                belief across generations and cultures. Officially, we subscribe
                to the documents of Westminster (c.1630) as the summary of
                our faith. This grounds us in Christ as our Prophet who still
                speaks.
                <strong style="font-weight: bold;">Think: doctrine
                    that is alive and an unwillingness to be
                    distracted by cultural fads</strong>
            </p>
            <p class="about-body-text">
                <strong>4. Sacramental - Christ as our Priest:
                </strong> Christ is "fleshed out" in a carefully
                designed four movement worship service that follows
                the logic of the gospel and culminates every week in
                a participation in eucharistic communion with
                Christ. Jesus is experienced in the body of Christ
                through different cultural styles specific to each
                local community (1 Cor. 10:14-17, Heb. 12:22-24,
                Rev. 4-5).
                <strong style="font-weight: bold;">Think: Friendly,
                    worshipful, mysterious</strong>
            </p>
            <p class="about-body-text">
                <strong>5. Communal - Christ as our King:</strong>
                Christ did not leave us as orphans, but joined us with Himself to
                the church, so to be a Christian is to be a part of the redeemed
                community. Many of us experience Christ first through the love of
                his body. We also take church government as an instrument of
                mercy seriously. This grounds us in Christ as our King.
                <strong style="font-weight: bold;">Think: loving,
                    humble accountability and

            <h1 class="about-sub-title">Our Story</h1>
            <div class="about-body-text">
                <p>It all began in the summer of 1991 when three
                    young families and a graduate student at Yale
                    scheduled a ferry ride from Bridgeport, CT to
                    Port Jefferson, NY. Their purpose was to meet up
                    with several church planters and pastors from
                    the Presbyterian Church in America (Tim Keller,
                    Skip Ryan and Charlie Drew) to discuss a
                    possible church plant in New Haven.</p>

                <p>Meanwhile, recent Gordon Conwell Seminary
                    graduate Preston Graham was scheduled to visit
                    New Haven in order to locate sufficient housing
                    for his family while a graduate student in
                    American Religious History at Yale. Having been
                    introduced to one of the families prior to
                    coming, Preston was invited to join them in
                    their providential ferry ride to "Port Jeff."
                    After about a three hour conversation on Long
                    Island, and while dreaming and scheming together
                    on the return trip back from Port Jeff, Preston
                    accepted an invitation from the small
                    contingency to lead a Bible Study while at Yale
                    until such time as the group could locate a
                    church planter.</p>

                <p>During the '91-'92 academic year, the group was
                    joined by a few others (about 8 in all) and met
                    every Thursday evening in the Westville area of
                    New Haven. As the year progressed, the group
                    began to discern a vision for a church in New
                    Haven that would blend together a progressive,
                    gospel-centered and missional-oriented emphasis
                    ("High Gospel") coupled with a classically
                    defined confessional, sacramental and
                    communal-oriented emphasis ("High Church) in
                    church planting. And the conviction for such a
                    church in New Haven escalated.</p>

                <p>Soon afterwards, on October 11,1992 at 9:30 am,
                    the "mission" stage of church planting was
                    initiated with a first worship service held at
                    the Amity Regional Junior High in Orange, CT. It
                    was of no small inconvenience that the worship
                    room was a small, windowless choir room with
                    chairs suitable for junior high students! The
                    sermon text that morning was Matthew 28 coupled
                    with Christ's promise "I will build my church"
                    (Mt 16). In attendance were 28 people, children
                    and adults combined (more children than adults).
                    Envisioned as a "quiet launch," there was
                    initially no advertisement of the service other
                    than by word of mouth. But the church began to
                    grow, if slowly.</p>

                <p>A high gospel, high church congregation was
                    born!</p>

                <p>As of the Spring of 2017, Mission Anabaino is
                    inspiring a multiplying momentum for both an
                    engagement in theological collaboration in
                    missional ecclesiology and church planting. At
                    present, Mission Anabaino consists of five local
                    church plants, 12 global church plants with 3
                    anchor churches including CPC New Haven. The
                    congregation at 135 Whitney Ave. continues to
                    flourish, albeit having to engage the increasing
                    challenge, and opportunities, of the
                    post-Christian, and yet post-secular, context of
                    our postmodern city.</p>
