                        face of shame
                        and sin because it's based in God's power! This
                        grounds us
                        in God's finished work on the cross, where he
                        forgave our
                        sins and reconciled us to himself. Everything we do
                        is
                        motivated from and by the gospel.

                        Christ did not leave us as orphans, but joined us
                        with Himself to
                        the church, so to be a Christian is to be a part of
                        the redeemed
                        community. Many of us experience Christ first
                        through the love of
                        his body. We also take church government as an
                        instrument of
                        mercy seriously. This grounds us in Christ as our
                        King.

                        <p>It all began in the summer of 1991 when three young
                            families and a graduate student at Yale scheduled a
                            ferry ride from Bridgeport, CT to Port Jefferson,
                            NY. Their purpose was to meet up with several church
                            planters and pastors from the Presbyterian Church in
                            America (Tim Keller, Skip Ryan and Charlie Drew) to
                            discuss a possible church plant in New Haven.</p>

                        <p>Recent Gordon Conwell Seminary graduate Preston
                            Graham was scheduled to visit New Haven to locate
                            housing for his family while studying American
                            Religious History at Yale. After being introduced to
                            one of the families, Preston was invited to join
                            their providential ferry ride to "Port Jeff." After
                            a three-hour conversation on Long Island, Preston
                            accepted an invitation to lead a Bible Study while
                            at Yale until the group could locate a church
                            planter.</p>

                            joined by a few others (about 8 in all) and met
                            every Thursday evening in the Westville area of New
                            Haven. As the year progressed, the group began to
                            discern a vision for a church in New Haven that
                            would blend together a progressive, gospel-centered
                            and missional-oriented emphasis ("High Gospel")

                            of church planting was initiated with a first
                            worship service held at the Amity Regional Junior
                            High in Orange, CT. The sermon text that morning was
                            Matthew 28 coupled with Christ's promise
                            "I will build my church" (Mt 16). In attendance were
                            28 people, children and adults combined (more
                            children than adults). A high gospel, high church
                            congregation was born!</p>
